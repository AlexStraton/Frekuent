# 🎯 Session Finder App

# ▶️ How to Run

To run the project, run ```npm install``` then ```npm run dev```

 -A small responsive app with a search functionality where users can choose to add or remove sessions to their schedule.
 
  I have used React Router and Fuse.js, as well as Tailwind for styling. This was coded in a bit over 2 hours.
  
# 📑 Still to do:
    - Register form
    - Improve styling
    - Use search function for the search functionality rather than Fuse.js

I used Fuse.js for the search as I am familiar with it and have worked with it extensively. It is a javascript library that does fuzzy search and finds results even with typos or partial matches.

Tailwind is my styling library of choice as I have also used it extensively in different projects and it allows the flexibility to adapt styling to the app's needs.
